# Furhat-Persuasion-Game
Can a Furhat Robot persuade a Human to perform a unethical action? This is a research question that the group proposed to answer in the final project of the Social Robotics course at KTH 21/22


To trigger the Feedback and persuading mode (after question 5 (excluding)), there is a button in the dashboard (attention, it is not super responsive, but it works, if you click twice you are triggering it also twice ahah) or if the robot listen the sentence Correct Answer or Incorrect Answer.

[This file](https://github.com/Joao-Tiago-Almeida/Furhat-Persuasion-Game/blob/main/PersuasionGame/src/main/kotlin/furhatos/app/persuasiongame/speech/ROBOT.tex) contains the information about the game:

2.   Number answered questions
3.   Mode of the ROBOT {neutral, commanding, friendly}
